Lama: 

I imported several libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, arabic_reshaper, and sklearn.

I loaded the data from a csv file "tamheer_2022.csv" into a pandas dataframe called "df".

I preprocessed by dropping some columns and removing any rows with missing values in specific columns.

I used the matplotlib library to create different plots such as bar plots and pie charts to visualize the distribution of data in the dataframe.

I used the Arabic reshaper library to display Arabic text in the plots correctly.

I created a correlation matrix to find the relationships between different columns.

Finally, I split the data into a training and testing set using the train_test_split function from the sklearn library.
